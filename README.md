## Why Mandalay?

Named after my personal ship in-game, the **Mandalay Stellar** – a heavily modified Alliance Chieftain configured for PvE dogfighting and tactical dominance.

This system was built for maximum immersion.  
You speak – the AI reacts.  
From supercruise maneuvers to subsystem sniping, everything is voice-driven.
